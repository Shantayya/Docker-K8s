Container orchestration automates the deployment,management,scaling and networkng of containers across the cluster. it focus on managing the lifecycle of containers. 
K8s  -> open-source platform for managing containarized workload and services. 

Verticaal scaling: To scale more, add one or more ram,cpu,memory to the one existing machine.
Horizontal scaling: To scale more, add more machines to the existing group of distributed systems.  

K8s objects:
compute: pod,node,namespace,deployment,Replicaset,statefulset,Deomonset
networking: service,ingress
storage: volume,persistentVolume, StorageClass, PersistentVolumeClaim

kubectl: command line utility used to interact with k8s cluster. communicates with API server throuh REST API calls for CRUD workloads in kubernetes. 

Control plane: 
is collection of multi components responsible for managing/controling K8s cluster globally. 
Individual control plane components can run on any machine in the cluster. But usually run on dedicated controller machines.

Kube-API-Server --> serves K8s API. primary interface to control plane and cluster itself. When interacting with K8s cluster we do so using K8s API.
ETCD --> ETCD is key-value db, stores the state of K8s cluster. X store app or db data
Kube-Scheduler --> handles scheduling of pods, irrespective of whether pods are running or stopped. 
Kube-Controller-Manager --> brain behind orchestration. It does controller utilities like detecting failed pods and restarting them.(manage desired and current state)
Cloud controller manager --> provides an interface between K8s and cloud platform. It is only used when using cloud based resources with K8s. 


K8s Nodes: 
are machines where containers managed by the cluster run. cluster can have any number of  nodes. 
Various node components manage containers on machine & communicate with control plane.

Kubelet --> k8s agent runs on each node. It communicate with control plane(API server) about state of node and ensures that containers(through CRE i.e containerd or docker) run on its node as instructed by control plane. 
Kubelets also handles the process of reporting container status and other data about container back to API server. 
Container Runtime --> is not build into k8s. Its a separate peice of software that is responsible to run comtainer on each machine. K8s supports docker/containerd etc
Kube-Proxy --> is network proxy. It runs on each node and provides networking between containers and services(single entrypoint which manages backend nodes) in the cluster by maintaining iptable.  

CNI: container networking interface maintains the routing rules for container communication inside cluster. 
CRI: container runtime interface acts as bridge between kubelets and container runtime. 
coreDNS: DNS service which resolves names to IP.
service: single entrypoint which manages backend nodes. pod to pod communication is very difficult without service as containers are not permanent. name and IP gets change if new container gets created.  so container can talk to service (virtual object. its not container rather configuraton) which manages the backend nodes(pods). 


-----Journey of kubectl request------

kubectl 	   kubectl				 kubectl					kube API server
 | 		  Client validation	--------------> form the HTTP request	-------------------->  server side validation		----------------> ETCD	
 ---------------> 1. check YAML syntax			1. forms API calls				1. performs authentication      --------------> controller 
 kubectl run	  2. misconfiguration			2. authentication and cert validation		 and authorization		 -------------> Scheduler
 kubectl apply	  3. non-supported resources		for user validation				2. verifies the API		-------------> kubelet +
		  4. fail fast mechanism to avoid	3. reads kubeconfig file									container
 		loading API server			4. submit pod spec to API server


1. kubectl forms API request and send it to the API server.
2. APi server authenticates and authorise
3. API server writes pod object to etcd data store. once write is successful, aknowladgement is sent to API server and to the client.
4. now pod is in pending state
5. Scheduler sees that new pod object is created but not bound to any node
6. Scheduler assigns node to the pod and udpates API server.
7. API server updates this to the etcd data store. 
8. kubelets keep querying the API server for any new work loads. it sees that new pod is assigned to it. 
9. kubelets instructs the container runtime like docker to create container and update the container state back to API server.
10. APi server update the pod state as running in etcd data store. 

kubectl	 <---------> API server	<--->	etcd			scheduler		kubelet		docker
			<-------------------------------------->
			<------------------------------------------------------------->
											 <-------------->	

pod : smallest deployable unit that holds and runs the container(one or more).
 
Kubernates cluster:
kubeadm is a tool that will simplify the process of setting of K8s cluster. 
install containerd/docker --> install K8s packages (kubeadm,kubelet,kubectl) --> initialize cluster with <sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr range --kubernates-version 1.24.0
--> setup .kube config command from output for cluster communication --> execute join command on nodes from output --> deploy calico network plugin 

kubectl get namespaces   ---list namespaces
kubectl get pods --namespace or -n my-namepsace  --list pods from my-namespace if namespace name not given cmd will fetch pods from default namespace
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
kubectl get pods -o wide --> get detailed info with PODS IP address and node name
kubectl get nodes --> list cluster nodes


High Availability in K8s:
K8s facilitates high availability apps but you can also design the cluster itself to be highly available. To do this you need multiple control plane nodes.

Control plane node1 ....control plane node2
kube-api-server		 Kube-api-server									
             ↑            ↑
              Load balancer
                 ↑
Worker node1     ↑
kubelets    -----↑

1. Stacked ETCD   ---> ETCD runs on same control plane node
2. External ETCD  ---> ETCD runs on separate machine but not on control plane node

K8s Management tool: 
There are variety of K8s management tools available. These tools interface with Kubernates to provide additonal functionality
Kubectl --> Official CLI for K8s. it is the main method you will work with K8s.
kubeadm --> is a tool that will simplify the process of setting of K8s cluster. 
Minikube --> allows you to automatically set up a local single-node k8s cluster. Its great for k8s dev purposes. 
Helm --> provides templating and package management for K8s objects. You can use it to manage your own templates (known as charts). you can download and use shared templates.
Kompose --> helps you translate docker compose files into K8s objects. If you use docker compose for some of your workflow then can move apps to K8s using Kompose.
Kustomize --> configuration management tool for managing K8s objects configurations.It allows you to share and re-use template configurations for K8s apps.


kubeconfig: file used by kubectl to retrieve the required configuration of kubernetes cluster or to communicate with API server of kubernetes cluster. 
by default, kubectl looks in below locations
1. $HOME/.kube dir
2. export KUBECONFIG=$KUBECONFIG:$HOME/.kube/config  			--> env variable
3. kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo view --minify		--> command line flag

kubeconfig file: user -->context,namespace --> cluster			--> context does the mapping of user to cluster 

context: refers to set of access parameters(cluster server,namespace,user) for kubernetes cluster. used when working with >1 clusters and have diff configurations.
kubectl config get-contexts/current-context/use-context <context-name> : Display available contexts/current context/Switch to a different context

---------------------------Pods-------------------------

Pod: smallest deployable unit that holds and runs the container(one or more). managed by controler manager. each pod has name and IP. containers within same pod shares same n/w,volume and namespace. pod spec is the YAML file that k8s use to describe about containers inside pod. 
pod lifecycle
1. pending: containers not created yet. in the state of downloading container image over n/w
2. running: pod is scheduled on node and atleast one container running state.
3. succeeded: pod exited with status 0 and will not restart
4. Failed: all containers in pod exited but atleast one with non-zero status
5. CrashLoopBackOff: container fail to start and tried again and again
6. Unknown: for some reason state of pod could not be obtained. 

container lifecycle:(waiting,running,terminated) 
pod restart policy:
  1. Always  --> default restart policy in K8s. containers always be restarted if they stop, or completed successfully
  2. On-Failure --> Will restart container only if container process exits with error code or containr detect to be unhealthy by liveness probe. X after successfully completed. 
  3. Never  --> never be restarted. even if container exits or liveness probe fails. 

multi-container pod design patterns:
1. Init Containers:are containers that run once during the startup process of pods. Pod can have any number of init containers and they will each run once (in order) to completion. you can use init containers to do variety of startup tasks. They are often useful in keeping main containers lighter and more secure by offloading startup tasks to separate container. (works like bootstrap script)
2. Sidecar: its an auxiliary container thats runs alongside and complements main app container. it does additional functionalities like logging,monitoring,security etc
3. Ambassador: proxy pattern. acts as gateway or mediator for n/w communication. often handling tasks such as routing,load balancing etc.
4. Adaptor: serves as translator between diff components. plays crutial role in enabling interoperability between diverse tech or services. (Log format changer)

image pull policy:
determine if the container image should be pulled from repo prior starting container. 
value		description
always		always pull	if tag is latest
ifNotPresent	if not exist	(default)
never		never pull

ImagePullBackOff: status condition occur while pulling image (Authen issue,n/w issue, image not availble,registry rate limit,registry not available etc)
		To avoid above issue due to auth we can use imagepullsecrets at container level. 

pause container: used to share the n/w namespace among container in pod for internal container communication plus ensure that IP address remains constant in container restart. 

imparative/declarative commands: 
imparative: command line argument
	kubectl run web --image=nginx:latest	--dry-run=client	--> shows what API object is being created at client side
	kubectl get po -o wide/json/yaml				--> shows deployed pods
	kubectl run web --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml		--> gives you manifest file
	kubectl run web --image=nginx --label="app=hazelcast,env=prod"	--> label is key value pair
	kubectl logs -f nginx						--> show pod logs. append -c containername -l key=value(label)	--tail=20 --since=1h
	kubectl delete po nginx	--force --grace-period=0		--> want to force kill. grace period is 30sec default
	kubectl edit po nginx						--> can update pod manifest file
	kubectl exec -it nginx -- command				--> exec command inside pod. if pod has >1 container then use -c containername. -- 										differentiates kubectl commands with actual sh command. 
	kunectl run curl --image=curlimages/curl -i --rm --restart=never -- curl IP		--> use --rm for temporary pods. 

	kubectl logs/describe (events)/events -n namespace_name		--> used for debugging

decalarative: describing k8s objects in yaml file
kubectl create -f podfile.yml				--> create prod
kubectl apply  -f podfile.yml				--> update pod	

Manifest/Spec file:   describe k8s objects in yaml file
Manifest file has 4 mandatory fields:
	1. apiVersion
	2. kind			--> type of resource(deployment,pod,service)
	3. metadata	
	4. spec			--> includes replicas,selector,template(spec--> containers) for pod etc

-----man pages--------------
# list all K8s API supported objects
kubectl api-resources
kubectl explain pod

Note: command(ENTRYPOINT) and CMD(arg) in kubenertes. use --command -- <arg> 
ex: --command ping -- 8.8.8.8

Ephemeral containers: additional container(with debug utilities like bash/sh/curl etc) in pod for debug purpose.  Not restarted when exit or pod removed or restarted.
	|________> Application container(distroless image)

kubectl debug -it ephemeral-demo<pod name> --image=busybox:1.2 --target=ephemeral-demo		--> create debug container in ephemeral-demo pod

----Labels,annotations and Selectors:
Labels are key-value pairs attached to the K8s objects like pod. run = <object name> is deafult label
kubect get po --show-labels
kubectl label po <podname> env=prod tier=frontend		--> add label to running containers. --overrite if want change existing one. 
kubectl label po <podname> env-					--> use key- to remove label

labels allows you to identify,select,operate on k8s objects. where as annotations are non-identifying metadata. Annotations can hold any kind of info which can be useful and provide context to DevOps teams. 

kubectl annotate po <podname> key=value

selectors: used to filter K8s objects based on labels. 
1. equality based selectors (=, !=)		--> used by Replication Controllers, services
kubectl get po --selector env=prod
2. set-based selectors	(in,notin,exists())	--> filter keys acccording to set of values. used by ReplicaSets, Deployments,DaemonSets. 
kubectl get po --selector env in (prod,qa)	


--------------------Replica Sets and Replica Controllers-------------(Reliability,Load balancing and scaling)
ReplicationController:  is deprecated and has been replaced by ReplicaSets. they use equality based selectors. 
ReplicaSet:  is a lower-level controller that ensures a specified number of replica Pods are running. use set based seletors. 

kubectl get rc/rs
kubectl delete -f replicaCntroller.yml
kubectl scale rc/rs nginx-rc/rs --replicas=10

Note: selector must be of same name as defined in pod metadata. otherwise throws error. 
ReplicaController.yml
apiVersion:v1
kind:ReplicaController / ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-rc
spec:
  replica:3
  selector:
   app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
     labels:			matchLabels:			--> here it will be matchLabels(AND operated) which shows set based selector for ReplicaSet. 
      app: nginx 			app: nginx	           we can use matchExpressions:(OR operated) for multiple selectors
    spec								       - key: app
      container:								 operator: In
      - name: nginx								 values: [nginx,prod]
        image: nginx
        port:
        - containerPort: 80

Note: if we manually create pod with same label as above then ReplicaController/Set terminate manually created pod by thinking Desired abd current pods number is same.  


-----------------Deployments and DeploymentController----------
Deployment:  is a higher-level controller that manages(internally creates) ReplicaSets and provides additional features like rolling updates,rollback,pause and resume update etc for deploying and updating applications.
Deployment is recommended way to deploy pod(deploymentname+rs-id+hash) or replicaSet. keep track of various deployed versions of apps for rollback. (not the case with ReplicaSet)

kubectl create deploy nginx --replica=5 --image=nginx:latest --port=80
kubectl get deploy
kubectl delete deployment nginx
kubectl rollout status deployment nginx
kubectl rollout history deplo nginx
kubectl set image deploy nginx nginx:1.4	--> change image of container.
kubectl scale deplo nginx --replica=10  

rollout: its a process of gradually deploying or updating your application containers. 
----deployment strategies:
1. recreate: old version is terminated and new version is rolled out. easy but expects downtime
2. Rolling/Ramped update: default strategy. new version is slowly rolled out by replacing old version. default 25% for both
	1. maxSurge: number of pods created on top of existing ones. 
	2. maxUnvailable: number of pods down at a time. 
Note: if maxSurge is 0 then maxUnvailable can't be 0
3. Blue-Green: initially user traffic goes to Blue(current version) deployment, when new version deployment ready, route traffic to green env.
having two env and switching between them for updates. 
4. Canary: testing new version with small group before rollout. 
5. A/B testing: comparing two versions by exposing diff user to each version. 


---------------Namespace----------------------
K8s Namespaces: K8s objects such as pods and containers, live in namespaces. namespaces provide a way to partition cluster resources between multiple users, teams, or applications. You can use namespaces to create isolated environments. 
4 default namespaces:
1. default : as name says its default namespace when we create any k8s object
2. kube-system - user dont have access to it. k8s object such as kubectl, api-server are created under kube-system namespace.
3. kube-public - publically accessible k8s objects are created user kube-public like Congfigmap, secrete etc
4. kube-node-lease - contains hear-beats of nodes in k8s cluster + each node has associated least object in namespace + determine availability of nodes

every resource gets unique name which is combinatin of (resource name + namespace) called FQDN. fully qualified domain name. 

#create namespace: my-namespace.yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: namespace
metadata:
  name: my-app-namespace

#define resource quota: resource-quota.yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
 name: my-app-quota
 namespace: my-app-namespace			--> bad practice to hard code namespace rather pass -n <namespace name> while deployment
spec:
 hard:
   pods:"number"
   requests.cpu:
   requests.memory:
   limit.cpu:
   limit.memory:


kubectl get ns		--> list namespaces
kubetl delete ns dev	--> very careful while deleting ns. we can assign roles to limit actions 
kubectl deploy -f specfile.yml -n <namespace name>		--> create deployment in perticular namespace

curl pod-ip.ns.pod.cluster.local		--> to communicate with pod in diff ns using pod-dns


---------------------Services--------------------------
service: single entrypoint which manages backend nodes. pod to pod communication is very difficult without service as containers are not permanent. name and IP gets change if new container gets created. so container can talk to service (virtual object. its not container rather configuraton) which manages the backend nodes(pods).

IP's are stable and balance the load. service identifies its member pods with selector so pod must have labels specified in selector of service. 
types of service:
1. ClusterIP: default. assigns stable internal IP to set of pods enabling communication within cluster. 
2. NodePort:
3. LoadBalancer
4. Headless (very imp of stateful apps)
5. ExternalName

apiVersion:
kind: Service
metadata:
spec:
  selector:
  ports:
  - protocol: 
    port: incoming port to service
    targetPort: outgoing port should be same as container port



Self draining K8s node: 
when performing maintainance, you may sometimes need to remove K8s node from service. To do this, you can drain the node. 
Containrs running on node will be gracefully terminated (and potentially rescheduled to another node)
kubctl drain node-name
kubectl drain node-name --ignore-daemonsets   (when draining a node you may need to ignore daemonsets i.e pods that are tied to each node. If you have any daemonset pods running on node then likely use --ignore-daemonset flag.

uncordon node: 
If node remains part of cluster, You can allow pods to run on node again when maintanance is complete using 
kubectl uncordon node-name
Note: uncordoning the node will not guarantee that pods get restored on same node again. 

backig up and restoring ETCD cluster data:
ETCD is backed data storage solution as such all K8s objects, apps and configurations are stored in etcd. so likely to backup cluster data by backing up etcd.
ETCDCTL_API=3 ectdctl --entpoints $ENDPOINT snapshot save <file-name>
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot restore <file-name>    --> you need to supply additional parametrs as restore operation creates a new logical cluster.

K8s object management:
you can use the kubectl to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources and view logs. 
kubectl get <object type> objectname -o <output-yaml/json/wide> --sort-by <JSONPath> --selector <label>
kubectl create -f <filename>   --- if we try to create object already exist an error will occur.
kubctl apply -f <filename>     ---same as create but if we apply on already existed object then it will modify.
kubectl delete <object type> ojbect-name
kubectl exec <pod-name> -c <container-name> -- <command>   -->used to run commands inside container.if pod has multiple conainers then specifiy container with -c otherwise optional.

kubectl declarative commands --> define object using the data structure like yaml/json. kubectl apply -f <filename>
kubectl imperative commands --> define objects using kubectl commands. kubectl create deployment my-deployment -- image=nginx --dry-run -o yaml. X create pods using it.
kubectl scale deployment my-deployment replica=5 or --replica 5 --record     ---> record a command

RBAC in K8s:It allows you to control what users are allowed to do and access within your cluster. example: we can use RABC to allow dev to read metadata and logs from
K8s pods but not make any changes to them. 

Cluster----------------------------------------    Roles and ClusterRoles are K8s objects that define a set of permissions. Role define permissons within perticuler
|                                             |    namespace and cluster role defines a cluster wide permissions not specific to single namespace.
|   Namespace---------     ClusterRole------  |
|   |  Role          |    |  permissions   |  |
|   |  permissions   |    |                |  |    RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding are objects that connect roles and cluster roles to users.
|   |                |    |                |  |

             Users/ServiceAccounts

K8s Service Account: In K8s, Service account is an account used by container processes within pods to authenticate with K8s API.if your pods needs to communicate with 
K8s API then you can use service accounts to control their access. A service account object can be created with some YAML just like other K8s object.
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata: 
 name: my-serviceaccount

you can manage access control for service accounts just like any other user, using RABC objects. 

Inspecting pod resource usage: 
Kubernates metrics server: In order to view metrics about the resources, pods and containers are using, we need an add-on to collect and provide that data. One such 
add-on is kubernates metrics server. Once we installed that add-on we can use top command to view data about resource usage in pods and nodes.  
kubectl top pod --sort-by <JSONpath> --selector <label>


Pods and Containers:
1. managing application configuration: When you are running appls in K8s, you may pass dynamic values to apps at runtime to control how they behave known as Apps Confign.
   ConfigMaps --> you can store configuration data in K8s using cm. configMaps store data in the form of key-value map. cm data can be passed to container apps. 
   Secrets --> similar to configMaps but are designed to store sensitive data such as passwords or API keys. create and used similar to cm. 
   Environment variable --> you can pass cm and secrets as env variables. These variables will be visible to container process at runtime. 
   ConfigurationVolumes --> cm and secret data passed to container in the form of mounted volumes. 

2. managing container resources: 
   Resource requests -->  allows you to define an amt of resources(cpu or memory) you expect a comtainer to use. K8s scheduler will use resource requests to avoid 
   scheduling pods on nodes that do not have enough resources. Note: scheduler wil not spin up pods unless have enough resources beforehand. 
   Resource Limits --> provide a way fr you to limit resources container can use. Container runtime is responsible to enforce resource limits.

3. Building self healing pods with restart policy:  K8s automatically restart containers when they fail or problem arises. 
   Always  --> default restart policy in K8s. containers always be restarted if they stop, or completed successfully
   On-Failure --> Will restart container only if container process exits with error code or containr detect to be unhealthy by livenes probe. X after successfully completed. 
   Never  --> always cause the pods container to never be restarted. even if container exits or liveness probe fails. 

4. Multi-container pods: K8s pods can have >1 containers called multi-container pods. In M-C pods containers share resources such as network(can communicate 
with another container on any port even if port X exposed to cluster) and storage.They can interact with one another, working together to provide functionality. 
Note: Its best practice to keep containers in separate pods unless they to share resources. 
   
5. Init container: are containers that run once during the startup process of pods. Pod can have any number of init containers and they will each run once (in order) to completion. 
you can use init containers to do variety of startup tasks. They are often useful in keeping main containers lighter and more secure by offloading startup tasks to separate container. 


Advanced pod allocation: 
K8s scheduling --> The process of assigning pods to nodes so kubelets can run them. K8s scheduler selects a suitable node for each pod and it takes following into account,
1. resource req vs available node resources
2. Various configuration that affect scheduling using node labels. + you can configure nodeSelector for your pods to limit which node the pod can be scheduled on +
you can also use nodeName to assign specific pod to node directly and bypass scheduling.
kubectl label nodes <nodename> special=true   ---> assigning special=true label to node

DaemonSet --> Automatically runs a copy of pod on each node. DaemonSet will run copy of pod on new node when they are added to the cluster. DaemonSet normally respect 
scheduling rules around nodeLabels, taints and tolerations. If pod would not normally schedule on node, daemonSet will not create copy of pod on that node.

Static pod --> A pod directly managed by kubelet on the node ( created in menifest location on worker node)  but not by K8s API server. They can run even if there is not any K8s API server. 
Kubelets automatically creates static pods from YAML menifest files on worker node. 
Mirror pod ---> Kubelet will create a mirror pod  for each static pod. Mirror pod allow you to see the status of Static pods via K8s API , but you cannot change 
or manage them via API server. 


K8s Deployments: K8s object that defines a desired state for replicaSet(A set of replica pods). Deployment controller seeks to maintain desired state creating,
deleting,  and replacing pods with new configurations. desired state includes,
1. replica: No. of replica pods deployment seek to maintain
2. Selector: used to identify replica pods managed by the deployment.
3. Template: temmplate pod defination used to create replica pods. 

scaling deployment: 
1. edit YAML: 
...
spec
 replica: 5
...
2. kubectl scale
kubectl scale deployment.v1.apps/my-deployment --replicas=5

Rolling update: allows yout o make changes to deployment pods at controlled rate, gradually replacing old pods with new one. This allows you to update your pods without incussing 
downtime. 
kubectl rollout status deployment.v1.apps/my-deployment  --> to see how rolling update is happening
kubectl set image deployment/my-deployment nginx=<version> --record      ----> command for rolling update
Rollback: If an update to the deployent cause a problem , yoyu can roll back the deployment to the previous working state. 


Kubernates network Model: Is set of standards that define how networking between pods behaves. There are variety of implementations of this model inlcuding 
calico network plugin.
Each pod has its unique IP address in cluster. Any pod can reach out other pod using pod's IP address. This creates a Vurtual network that allows Pods to easily 
communicate with each other, regardless of which node they are running. 

DNS in K8s:
K8s virtual network uses DNS to allow pods to locate other pods and services using domain name instead of IP address. 
This DNS runs as a service within cluster. you can easily find it in kube-system namespace. 
pod-domain-names --> all pods in K8s cluster get following domain name form
pod-ip-address.namespace-name.pod.cluster.local         ---> 192.172.17.10.default.pod.cluster.local

Network policies: K8s network policy is a object that allows to control the flow of network communication to and from pods. This allows you to build more secure cluster
network by keeping pods isolated from traffic they do not need.
podSelector: Determines to which pods in namespace network policy applies. podselector selects pods using pod labels. 
Note: By default pods are considered non-isolated and completely open to all communication. If the network policy selects a pod, the pod is considered isolated 
and will only be open to traffic allowed by network policies. 
spec: 
 podSelector: 
  matchLabels: 
    role: db 

network policy can apply to Ingress, Egress or both. from and to selectors --> FromSelector selects ingress traffic that will be allowed
to selector selctes egres traffic that will be allowed. 
spec: 
 ingress: 
  - from: 
    ...
 egress:
  - to: 
    ...
 
from and to selector rules applies to,
1. podselector					2. namespaceSelector		                    3. ipBlock								
select pods to allow traffic to/from             Select namespaces to allow traffic from/to        Select an IP range to allow traffic to/from
spec:                                           spec:                                                spec: 
 ingress:                                         ingress:                                             ingress: 
 - from:                                          - from:                                              - from: 
   - podSelector:                                   - namespaceSelector:                                 - ipBlock:
       matchLabels:                                     matchLabels:                                        cird: 172.0.0.0/16
        app: db                                           app: db
    

ports: Specifies one or more ports that will allow traffic 
spec: 
 ingress: 
  - from: 
    ports: 
     - protocol: tcp
       port: 80


K8s Services: provides a way to expose an application running on set of pods. They provide an abstract way for clients to access applications without needing to be aware 
of application pods. 
                        pods (endpoints --> backend entity to which service routes traffic)
client --> Service--->  pods (endpoints)     
                        pods (endpoints)

Each service has type and Service Type determines how and where the service will expose your application. There are 4 types,
1. ClusterIP  --> expose service only within cluster network
2. NodePort  --> expose service outside the cluster network. (should be between 30000-32767) not suitable for prod use case. 
3. LoadBalancer  --> also expose service outside of cluster network. But they use an external cloud load balancer to do so. works only with cloud platform.
4. Headless service -> used for statefullsets where each pod is not identicle. set  ClusterIp=none to use headless service. so app pod can directly connect using pod ip address.

Service DNS names: K8s DNS assigns DNS names to services allowing applications within cluster to locate them easily.service FQDN has following form,
service-name.namespace-name.svc.cluster-domain.example   --> default cluster domain is cluster.local
note: service fqdn can be used to reach service from within any namespace in the cluster. However, pods within same namespace can also simply use servicename.

managing access from outside world to K8s service: 
Ingress is K8s object that manages external access to services in the cluster. An Ingress is capable of providing more functionality than a simple nodePort service, 
such as SSL termination, advanced LoadBalancing, or Name based virtual Hosting. 
external world --> Ingress --> service

Ingress controller: Ingress objects do nothing by themselves. Ingress needs controller for providing extrnal access to your services. ex: nginx,traffic,haproxy etc
Ingress defines a set of routing rules. each rule has set of paths with backend specified. 
ingress controller evaluates rules + manages redirection and entrypoint to cluster
apiVersion: networking.K8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata: 
  name: my-ingress
spec: 
  rules: 
  - http: 
    paths: 
    - path: /somepath
      pathType: prefix
      backend: 
        service: 
          name: my-service
          port: 
            number: 80
            or
            name: web (for namedPort service)


K8s Storage: 
The container FS is ephemeral. If container is deleted or re-created in K8s then data stored on container FS is lost. 
Volumes: allow you to store data outside of container FS while allowing the container to access data at runtime. Volume offer simple way to 
provide external storage to containers within pod spec. 
syntax: 
Volumes -> In Pod spec, they specify volume type, where and how the data is stored.
volumeMounts -> In Container spec, refer to volumes in pod spec and prvide mount Path

example: 
apiVersion: v1
kind: pod
metadata: 
  name: volume-pod
spec: 
 containers: 
 - name: busybox
   image: busubox
   volumeMounts: 
   - name: my-volume
     mountPath: /output
 - volume: 
   - name: my-volume
     hostPath: 
      path: /data 
      or 
      emptyDir: {}

Note: We can also use mountVolumes to mount same volume on multiple containers. 
Common Volume Types: 
1. hostPath: stores data in specified directory on K8s node.
2. emptyDir: Stores data on dynamically created loc on K8s node. This dir exists as long as pod exist on node. vry useful to share data between containers. 

Persistent volume--> are slightly more advanced form of volume. they allow you to treat storage as abstract resource and consume it 
using pods. 
apiVersion: v1
kind: persistentVolume
metadata: 
  name: my-pv
spec: 
  storageClassName: localdisk
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: recycle        --> determines how the storage rsrc can be reused when pv claims deleted. 
  capacity: 
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes: 
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostpath: 
    path: /var/output

pods --> PersistentVolume Claim --> persistent Volume --> External Storage
various volume types support storage method: NFS, cloud storage, configMaps, secrets, simple dir on K8s node etc
persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy types: 
Retain --> keeps all data. admin to manually cleanup data and prepare for storage reusage. 
delete --> delete underlying storage (only works with cloud storage)
recycle --> automatically deletes all data and allowing pv to be reused. 

StorageClass --> administrator can create storagecalss called slow to describe low performance but inexpensive storage and another called fast for high performance
and costly resource. 
apiversion: v1
kind: storageClass
metadata: 
  name: slow or fast
provisioner: kubernates.io/no-provisioner
allowVolumeExpansion: true              --> if not set to true attempting to resize volume throws error. 

PersistentVolumeClaim -> Represents a users req for storage resource. when pvc is created it look for pv. 
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata: 
 name: my-pvc
spec: 
 storageClassName: localdisk
 accessModes: 
 - ReadWriteOnce
 resources: 
   requests: 
     storage: 100Mi


apiVersion: v1
kind: pod
metadata: 
  name: volume-pod
spec: 
 containers: 
 - name: busybox
   image: busubox
   volumeMounts: 
   - name: my-volume
     mountPath: /output
 - volume: 
   - name: my-volume
     persistentVolumeClaim:
       claimName: my-pvc
